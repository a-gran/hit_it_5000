# Game Hit_it_5000

## Description
This is a game that I made in 2018. It's a simple game where you have to hit the ball with the paddle. The ball will bounce off the walls and the paddle. The goal is to hit the ball as many times as possible before it falls off the screen. The game is made using the Pygame library in Python.

## How to play
To play the game, you need to have Python installed on your computer. You also need to have the Pygame library installed. You can install Pygame by running the following command in your terminal:

```
pip install pygame
```
